# Login Form and User Card Testing Practice

## Description

This project is a simple React application featuring:

- A Login Form that handles user authentication.
- A User Card to display user details upon successful login.

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for developers to practice writing tests using React Testing Library and Vitest in a Vite-based setup. It includes:

- Form validation using react-hook-form and zod.
- API interactions with mock data.
- Preconfigured environment for testing React components.

## Features

- 🖋️ **Form Validation**: Validates inputs like username and password with react-hook-form and zod.
- 🧾 **Dynamic User Card**: Displays user information upon login success.
- 🔬 **Test-Friendly Setup**: Configured for React Testing Library and Vitest.
- 🚀 **Mock Support**: Includes mock data for testing (user data, API calls, errors).

  gender: "male",
  image: "https://dummyjson.com/icon/michaelw/128",
  accessToken: "...",
  refreshToken: "...",
};
```

#### Mock API URL:

```typescript
export const urlReqMock = "https://dummyjson.com/auth/login";
```
